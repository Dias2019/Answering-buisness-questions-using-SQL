# Answering-buisness-questions-using-SQL

In this guided project, we're going to practice using our SQL skills to answer business questions. In each step, we'll give you a task, and you'll need to:
- Write a SQL query to extract the relevant data
- Create plots where necessary to visualize the data
- Write a short paragraph, drawing conclusions and explaining the data and/or visualizations <br><br>
